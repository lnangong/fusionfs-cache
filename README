
What is FusionFS
	- In short, FusionFS is a completely distributed file system, that said, nothing (at all) is centralized
		including meta data management. 

What is working
	- File create/open/read/write/close/remove
	- Direcotry create/read/remove
	
What is NOT working (We might add support for the followings if some applications require them)
	- File rename/link/slink
	- Directory rename
	- Other POSIX interfaces 

How to install fusionfs:
	1) Make sure all dependent libraries are specified, e.g. echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
		:/usr/local/lib:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/ffsnet/:/home/dongfang/fusionFS/src/udt4/src
	2) Install FUSE for your Linux distribution
	3) Install Google Protocol Buffer 
	4) Go to ./src/zht/ and run Makefile
	5) Go to ./src/udt/ and run Makefile
	6) Go to ./src/ffsnet/, run Makefile
	7) Go to ./src, run Makefile

How to use fusionfs on servers:
	1) `rm -rf fusion_root/*` to cleanup your scratch data
	2) ./start_service to start the backup services
	3) ./start to run fusionfs
	4) ./stop to stop fusionfs
	5) ./stop_service to stop all services

How to use fusionfs on clusters:
	0) Specify list of nodes on /src/zht/neighbor
	1) ./cleanAll to `make clean` everything
	2) ./compileAll to `make` everything
	3) ./start_service_all to start services on all nodes
	4) ./start_all to start fusionfs on all nodes
	5) ./stop_all to stop all fusionfs on all nodes
	6) ./stop_service_all to stop all services on all nodes

How to test fusionfs with IOZone:
	1) It's trivial to run IOZone on the local node
	2) To test multiple nodes:
		2.1) Create a file on node A, say `touch testfile1`
		2.2) On node B, run: `iozone -awpe -s 1m -r 4k -i 0 -i 1 -i 2 -f testfile1`
		2.3) Now check back in node A and verify testfile1 has 1MB by `ls testfile1 -lh`

Update history:
	07/22/2012: fixed a bug in ffsnet.c::_getaddr(); tested IOzone on two nodes
	07/21/2012: update ZHT for new _lookup() signature and return code, restructure code and update Makefiles
	07/20/2012: major changes, tested on two nodes Fedora and Fusion
	07/17/2012: remote file removal supported and tested on two nodes
	07/16/2012: all one-node test cases have passed over two nodes - Fedora and Fusion.
	07/15/2012: started testing on single node (test_plan.txt added): directory passed; files on root directory passed 
	07/09/2012: clean up the warnings
	07/05/2012: hsearch replaced by ZHT
  	06/27/2012: read with UDT
	06/01/2012: read/write with LFTP
	05/22/2012: read/write with SCP

TODO:
	*[important]Support remote rename
		- Add service to ffsnetd `rename file`, or other design?
	*[important]how to select and maintain replica nodes
	
Note:
    *If you make your desktop run ffsnetd service, please make sure no firewall is blocking this service from outside request.
		- In Fedora, you can turn off firewall by `sudo service iptables stop`
		- Note that there's no firewall inside IBM Bluegene
